What is MCP of Claude,"MCP (Model Context Protocol) server adds context and capabilities, exposing specific functions to AI applications through this protocol. It typically focuses on particular integration points, such as GitHub for repository access. The MCP client, integrated within host applications, handles connections with these servers, translating between the hosts requirements and the Model Context Protocol."
